## Overview

The goals of the project are:

1. pre-process data of hotel recommendations for content based recommender,
2. select best user and item features,
3. tune the model,
4. compare the results against Amazon recommender.

Data preparation is done in <code>project_1_data_preparation.ipynb</code>



Defining features, implementing recommender, tunning, and testing the recommender are included in <code>project_1_recommender_and_evaluation_approach1.ipynb</code>

and

<code>project_1_recommender_and_evaluation_approach2.ipynb</code>

The difference between approaches is generation of negative interactions in fit function.
